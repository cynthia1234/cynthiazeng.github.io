<p>Thank you for taking the interest to learn more about me!  </p> 
<p> I am a prospective graduate student for mathematics. I completed my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Imperial College London. Then, I worked for a quant fund in London as a data scientist. I left my job in June, 2018 because I want to return to academia. Currently, I am taking a gap year, see travel updates in my Personal Blog. </p> 

<h3>Background:</h3>
<p> I attended an international school in Beijing, and I speak Mandarin and English. I have a younger sister, a younger brother, and a three-legged dog. </p> 
	
<h3>Interests:</h3>
	<p> Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, tennis, yoga, volleyball, reading, and piano. During my undergraduate degree, I was the social representative for the hiking society, and completed many challenges such as a 40-mile navigation challenge which took 17 hours in total. I enjoy yoga because it teaches me to handle stress. One of my goals during the gap year is to become a yoga teacher so I can share this passion with others.</p> 

<h3>Volunteering:</h3>
<p> Volunteering has been an important part of my life since high school. Since my dog's car accident (hence he has only 3 legs), I became a volunteer at the animal hospital during high school. This experience helped me discover my interests for volunteering. Since then, I spent many summer breaks volunteering: an environmental non-profit organisation, a rice farm in Taiwan, an organic goat's chesse farm in France, a mountain school in Nepal. </p>
