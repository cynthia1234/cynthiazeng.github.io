	<p>Thank you for taking the interest to learn more about me :)   </p> 
<p> I am a gap year student and traveler. I hope to use this time to plan my graduate studies, gain some knowledge into new things (such as completing a Yoga Teacher Training course and improve my Italian language skills), and take some time to think about life. Previously, I worked in the financial industry in London. Before that, I was a mathematics student at Imperial College London. </p> 

<p> You can find my "official" CV here. </p> 

<p> Alternatively, you can keep reading, and I will try to explain to you where I come from, and where I am trying to go. </p> 

<p> I grew up in Beijing, China, although I used to live in Toronto for a while when I was very young. I attended public schools in Beijing until middle school, and then I attended an international high school. I decided to study abroad in the UK because I liked its rigorous and intensive style - so I could learn mathematics rigorously, and meet some of the most intelligent students from all over the world. Then I decided to work in industry because I hoped to learn about the "real world". Funnily enough, after experiencing what it means to work in industry, I realised that I much prefer to enjoy intellectual autonomy - something you can only get by being in academia. So I left my job to take a gap year in preparation for applying to graduate schools. </p> 

<p> The first stop during my gap year is at the MIT Media Lab. I am very touched by Dr. Danielle Wood's vision in developing technology to promote justice. I sent her an email after watching her TED talking (here), and I was very lucky to be able to spend a summer working in her lab. Basically, we developed a computational methodology to simulate various risks to model the health of mangrove forests in Rio. More details of my project here. I really enjoyed the academic environment in MIT, and I also really enjoyed doing scientific research. This project reinforced my determination to pursuing graduate studies, and I feel very lucky for this opportunity. </p> 

<p> The next stage for my gap year is to spend some time at home. Since 4 years ago, when I left home for my Bachelor's degree at the age of 17, I haven't had the chance to spend a longer period (i.e. > 1 month) at home. I usually spend my summers to volunteer, travel or do an internship. After 4 years being away from home, I realised that my parents are the wisest and the best people I can learn from! </p> 

<p> Then, I plan to pursue a Yoga Training Course in Thailand. (Initially, I wanted to do it in India, but my mom wouldn't allow it due to safety concerns...so Thailand is also a good option.) I have been practicing yoga by going to classes for 4 years, it helped me go through stressful and lonely times away from home. So I really hope to use this opportunity to improve my techniques, and also become a yoga teacher to share it with more people in the future. </p> 

<p> After this training course, I haven't decided 100% what I would like to do. Potentially, I am considering to spend a semester abroad studying art and design related courses in Florence, Italy. I think that my undergraduate degree has been a very focused degree in mathematics, which taught me to be logic and precise. However, I am also a creative person who likes to express individuality. So I would like to use my gap year to free my mind, and gain different perspectives into artistic subjects. In addition, I have been self-studying Italian for a year, so studying in Italy would allow me to improve my Italian. </p> 

<p> Last but not least, I try to keep track of my random thoughts when I travel, and you can read it here. </p>
