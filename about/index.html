<p>Thank you for taking the interest to learn more about me!  </p>


<h3>Background:</h3>
<p> I grew up in Beijing, where I attended first public school and later an international high school. < br /> 
	I have a younger sister, a younger brother, and a three-legged dog. </p>
		
<p>  I went to London for my undergraduate studies in mathematics. <br /> 
	After completing my Bachelor's degree, I worked in the financial industry in London. <br /> 
	I had learned a lot working as a data scientist for a quantitative fund; <br/> 
	however, I felt pursuing academic endeavours was a path closer to my heart.<p/> 
	
<p> 
	So After 1 year in industry, I decided to take a gap year and then return to school.<br /> 
	During the gap year, I spent some time traveling, completed yoga teacher training, <br/> 
	and did an internship in Shanghai to stay closer to my parents. </p>

<h3>Interests:</h3>
	<p> Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, tennis, yoga, volleyball, reading, and piano. <p /> 
	<p> During my undergraduate degree, I was the social representative for the hiking society, and completed many challenges such as a 40-mile navigation challenge which took 17 hours in total.</p>

<h3>Volunteering:</h3>
<p> Volunteering has always been an important part of my life. <p /> 
<p> I am inspired by people like my stepmother, who is a devoted social worker and runs a successful non-profit environmental organisation in China.<br /> 
	Thanks to her, I had discovered the joys of volunteering. <br/> 
	I spent many summer breaks volunteering, including: a leading environmental non-profit organisation in China, a rice farm in Taiwan, an organic goat's chesse farm in France, a mountain school in Nepal.<p/> 

<p> In the future, I hope to continue my volunteering endeavours, and contribute to making our world a better place. </p>
