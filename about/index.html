<p>Thank you for taking the interest to learn more about me!  </p> 
<p> I am a prospective graduate student for mathematics, who is currently taking a gap year. I completed my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Imperial College London. Then, I worked in the asset management industry as a quantitative analyst. I left my job in June of 2018 because I want to return to academia. Currently, I am taking a gap year. If you are interested in my updates during this gap year, please go to my Personal Blog. </p> 

<p class="thick">Background:</p>
<p> I grew up in Beijing and attended an international school. My family used to live in Toronto, so I speak both Mandarin and English. I have a younger sister, a younger brother, and a three-legged dog. </p> 
	
<p class="thick">Interests:</p>
	<p> I have many interests including hiking, tennis, yoga, volleyball, reading, and piano. During my undergraduate degree, I was the social representative for the hiking society, and I also completed many interesting challenges such as a 40-mile navigation challenge which took me 17 hours in total. I also enjoy yoga because it teaches me to handle stress. One of my goals during my gap year is to become a yoga teacher so I can help others.</p> 

<p class="thick">Volunteering:</p>
<p> Volunteering has been an important part of my life since high school. Since my dog's car accident (hence he lost a leg), I became a volunteer at the animal hospital during high school. I discovered the joys of volunteering. Then, I spent many summer breaks volunteering: an environmental non-profit, rice farm in Taiwan, organic goat's chesse farm in France, mountain school in Nepal. </p>
