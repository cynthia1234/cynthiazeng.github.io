	<h1>Past Projects</h1>
	<p> 
		Here, I list several research projects I have completed in the past. So you can read into more details about them compared to the short version in my <a href="/projects/cv_4.pdf">CV</a>.
	</p> 
	
	<h2> Opinion Dynamics </h2>
	<p> 
		This is my undergraduate research project. I was intrigued by the sense of surprise after the 2016 UK-EU Referendum result, and decided to seek for a mathematical explanation for this volatile opinion shift. I used an agent-based modelling framework, and applied statistics mechanics to describe the dynamics of opinion influence among individuals. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		The model assumes that some of the individuals are more stubborn than others regarding political viewpoints, that they are unlikely to change their mind. Therefore, we separate our agents into: open-minded and stubborn ones, each holding initially an opinion: A or B. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To simulate the interactions, we randomly allocate agents into subgroups of size n (a small odd number), and we let open-minded agents update to local majority opinion, whilst stubborn agents do not update. We shuffle and regroup the agents many times, and study the overall distribution of opinion A and B. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		This model allows one to study how does the initial composition of agents (such as the level of stubborn agents, and the initial opinion allocatin) lead to different opinion evolvement, and to different voting outcomes. Two major findings from this project are: </p> 
		<ol>
			<li> 
				The initial composition of predominantly open-minded agents plus a small but sufficient portion of stubborn agents leads to the most volatile opinion dynamics in this system, and can be determined purely by the level of stubborn agents. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Decreasing subgroup size, i.e. increasing information exchange frequency, can enhance minority opinion spread by the stubborn agents, leading to enhanced "stubborn effect". 
			</li>		
		</ol>
	
	<p> To put this finding into the context of "Brexit" vote, we can find several evidence to suggest that such "stubborn effect" has been an important factor contributing to this unexpected referendum outcome. Firstly, the younger generation tend to be less fixed to supporting a particular political party, hence the agent population is predominantly open-minded, leading to potentially volatile opinion shifts. Secondly, the use of social media increases information exchange, and allows the system to be more well-mixed, hence leading to an enhanced "stubborn effect". What would account for the "stubborn effect" in our society? One interpretation can be Populism, because it can effectively make individuals fixed upon a certain opinion, and even turn them into emotional influencers.
