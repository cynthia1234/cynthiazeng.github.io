	<h1>Past Projects</h1>
	<p> 
		Here, I list several research projects I have completed in the past. So you can read into more details about them compared to the short version in my <a href="/projects/cv_4.pdf">CV</a>.

	<h2> Opinion Dynamics </h2>
	<p> 
		This is my undergraduate research project. I was intrigued by the sense of surprise after the 2016 UK-EU Referendum result, and decided to seek for a mathematical explanation for this volatile opinion shift. I used an agent-based modelling framework, and applied statistics mechanics to describe the dynamics of opinion influence among individuals. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		The model assumes that some of the individuals are more stubborn than others regarding political viewpoints, that they are unlikely to change their mind. Therefore, we separate our agents into: open-minded and stubborn ones, each holding initially an opinion: A or B. We let agents interact and update opinions according to certain rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		This model allows one to study how does the initial composition of agents (such as the level of stubborn agents, and the initial opinion allocatin) lead to different opinion evolvement, and hence to different voting outcomes. One social implication is that Populism can spread minority opinions effectively. Another application of this model is to forecast election outcome using polling data.

	<h2> Complex Systems Modelling to Simulate Mangrove Ecosystem </h2>
		<p>
			After leaving my job in June, 2018, I completed a research project at the MIT Media Lab. The research topic is developing a complex systems modelling approach to study the coastal mangrove ecosystem in Rio de Janeiro, which is under two-sided threats from landward urban expansion pressure and seaward sea-level rise pressure. We developed a multi-agent computational model to capture various risk factors from: urban areas, agriculture areas, the sea, transportation. Illustrated below is a logic map identifying the interactions among agent types and a summary of computational steps to simulate the growth (or loss) of mangrove forests. This project serves as a prototype to develop tools for urban planning, which can intake both environmental and social factors. Our collaborators include mangrove biologists and urban planning officials from Rio. </p>
