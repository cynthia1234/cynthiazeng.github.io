	<h2> Opinion Dynamics </h2>
	<p> 
		This is my undergraduate research project. I was intrigued by the sense of surprise after the 2016 UK-EU Referendum result, and decided to seek for a mathematical explanation for this volatile opinion shift. I used an agent-based modelling framework, and applied statistics mechanics to describe the dynamics of opinion influence among individuals.
